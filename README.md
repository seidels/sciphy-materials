# SciPhy materials

Here, we publish all scripts to reproduce the analyses in the manuscript *Sciphy: A Bayesian phylogenetic framework using sequential genetic lineage tracing data* available as a [preprint on bioRvix](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.01.615771v1)

Refer to the README file within each figure directory for instructions on running the code to reproduce that respective figure.

If you experience difficulties re-running the analyses, either post an issue here if it concerns the scripts, or post an issue on the [SciPhy github repository](https://github.com/azwaans/SciPhy) if it concerns the SciPhy package.
