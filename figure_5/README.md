# Figure 5

To generate panel C, the filtered data can be plotted using the script `plot_figure_5_C.R`

To generate the plots in panels B, D-E, the analysis on 2 time change points detailed in `inference_output/4-mGASv2-skyline-ou.xml` has to be run first using SciPhy. The plots are then generated with their corresponding R scripts `plot_figure_5_B.R`, `plot_figure_5_D.R`, `plot_figure_5_E.R`

## Generate alignments

**Please note that the data will only be made publicly available upon publication.** In the meantime, we are sharing empty placeholder files, such as `processed_data/mGASv2_Lane2_CellByTape_filtered_for_8barcodes.RDS`, to demonstrate the structure of the data pipeline.


To generate the alignment underlying the analyses, run the `run.sh` executing the data preprocessing pipeline to be found in  `./processing_scripts/`.
