For the benchmark on simulated data we reuse 9 datasets from the validation study.

The alignments can be found under ./alignments/.

We apply SciPhy, ordered-upgma, upgma, TiDeTree to the alignments. Their output can be found under their respective output folders, e.g. sciphy_output.

All functions for picking alignments for the benchmark, runnning upgma and plotting the results can be found under ./scripts.
